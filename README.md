An app to tag photos by renaming them to include the tags.

The app lets the user add and remove tags from a master list of tags, and add/remove tags that exist in the master list to individual photos.

The app keeps track of the times the photos were changed as well as their previous name, to let users revert a photo back to a previous name.

It keeps track with a logfile created in the directory the app is stored in, which also retains the master list of tags so users can pick up where they left off.
