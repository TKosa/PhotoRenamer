#PhotoRenamer

###About

An app to tag photos by renaming them to include the tags.
A logfile is kept of the master list of tags of a directory, as well as all previous names of images and a timestamp of when they were renamed. The app will let users add tags to the master list, as well as add and remove tags from individual photos, and revert a photo's name to one of its prior names.
